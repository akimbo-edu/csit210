Errors:

1. Change Alert to alert
    - "The public type alert must be defined in its own file"
    - Class name must match file name

2. Change Emergency to emergency
    - No error because "Emergency" is part of a string, it is not an identifier or keyword

3. Remove the first quotation mark in the string
    - "'An' cannot be resolved to a variable"...
    - "An" is treated as an identifier because there is no double-quote, error thrown because "An" is not a declared variable

4. Remove the last quotation mark in the string.
    - "String literal is not properly closed by a double-quote"
    - String doesn't close, compiler can't find where it ends, ");" is treated as part of the string

5. Change main to man
    - "Main method not found in file"
    - Compiler doesn't have a program entry because of the lack of a "main" method

6. Change println to bogus
    - "The method bogus(String) is undefined for the type PrintStream"
    - A method "bogus" has not been defined

7. Remove the semicolon at the end of the println statement
    - "Syntax error, insert ';' to complete BlockStatements"
    - Missing semicolon to denote statement end to compiler

8. Remove the last brace in the program
    - "Syntax error, insert '}' to complete ClassBody
    - Class definition incomplete without brace to tell the compiler where it ends
