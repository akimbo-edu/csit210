Create an application that creates and prints a random phone number in the following form:

```
XXX-XXX-XXXX
```

Include the dashes in the output. Do not let the first three digits contain an 8 or 9 (but don't be more restrictive than that), and make sure that the second set of three digits is not greater than 742.  

Hint:  Think through the easiest way to construct the phone number.  Each digit does not have to be determined separately.
