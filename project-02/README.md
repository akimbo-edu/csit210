### Instructions
Create a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for a month. A loop should then prompt the user to enter each of his or her expenses for the month and keep a running total. When the loop finishes, the program should display the first and last name, each entry, and the total amount that the user is over or under budget.
