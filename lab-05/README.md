The outer loop will iterate once each year. The inner loop will iterate 12 times, once each month. Each iteration of the inner loop will ask the user to display the number of months, the total inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month for the entire period.

### INPUT VALIDATION
Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of years. Do not accept negative numbers for the monthly rainfall.
